If program file is in :   `/home/diablo/Documents/`   

Command:
```
os.chdir("/home/diablo/")  
```

and then

```
 try with open("text.txt", "w") as var3:
```

**Answer:**

After `os.chdir("/home/diablo/")`, your current working directory becomes `/home/diablo/`. When you then use `with open("text.txt", "w")`, Python will look for the file in `/home/diablo/`, not in `/home/diablo/Documents/` where your file actually exists.

Since you're using **write mode (`"w"`)**, Python will **create a new file** called `text.txt` in `/home/diablo/`, leaving your original file in `/home/diablo/Documents/` untouched.
